Flow of the architecture

1.	Frontend Request Handling:

   * The Cloud CDN receives user requests and caches content to lower latency.
   
   * The Cloud Load Balancer receives non-cached requests and directs them to the relevant backend service (GKE or GCE).

2.	Application Processing:

   * GKE handles requests for updated services (such ERP microservices or e-commerce).
   
   * Requests that have not yet been modernized or containerized are handled by legacy workloads hosted on GCE.

   * GKE and mainframe modernization services work together to migrate ERP.

 3.	Data Flow:

   * Cloud SQL is used by applications to exchange relational transactional data.
   	
   * For a smooth transfer, Datastream replicates real-time data between on-premises databases and Cloud SQL or Cloud Spanner.

   * BigQuery receives transactional or operational data for analytics.

4.	Storage & Backup:

   * Cloud storage is where backups and application data are kept.
   
   * Filestore offers shared file systems to applications that require long-term storage.

5.	Networking:

   * Cloud VPN offers safe communication between the Google Cloud environment and on-premises infrastructure.
     
   * VPC manages service segmentation and traffic routing.

6.	Monitoring & Security:

   * The Operations Suite keeps an eye on every service for alerts and performance.
     
   * DLP is used to ensure data compliance, and IAM is used to handle access control.

7.	Disaster Recovery:

   * For high availability, backups (Cloud Storage) and critical databases (Cloud SQL, Spanner) include failover systems or secondary replicas in several locations.
